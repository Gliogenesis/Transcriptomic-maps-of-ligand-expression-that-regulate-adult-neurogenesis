# Transcriptomic-maps-of-ligand-expression-that-regulate-adult-neurogenesis
ABSTRACT In the adult central nervous system (CNS), the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the forebrain is the largest and most active source of neural stem cells (NSCs) that generates mainly neurons and few glial cells lifelong that are regulated by a number of external stimuli. A large body of evidences in the field have shed light on the effects of distinct families of signaling ligands (i.e. morphogens, growth factors, secreted molecules that alter signaling pathways) in regulating NSC biology. However, most of the research has focused on the mRNA expression of individual or few signaling ligands and their pathway components in specific cell types of the CNS in the context of neurogenesis. A single unifying study that underlines the expression of such molecules comprehensively in different cell types in spatial contexts has not yet been reported. In this study, by using whole genome transcriptome datasets of individual purified cell specific populations of the adult CNS, the SVZ niche, NSCs, and performing a bioinformatic meta-analysis of signaling ligands, their expression in the forebrain were uncovered. Therein, we report that a large plethora of ligands are abundantly expressed in the SVZ niche, largely from the vasculature than from other sources that may regulate neurogenesis. Intriguingly, this sort of analysis revealed a number of ligands with unknown functions in neurogenesis contexts that warrants further studies. Altogether, this study serves as a framework for investigators in the field for understanding the expression patterns of signaling ligands and pathways regulating neurogenesis.
